                Like the <a href = "splattershot.html">Splattershot</a>, the Splattershot jr is a very basic shooter. However, it has more spread and less range and damage than the regular Splattershot.

                The Splattershot Jr resembles its original design from Splatoon while also receiving a blocky look.
            </p>
            <p>
                The model is mainly ink colored with purple on the top cap, trigger, and nozzle of the weapon. The model was made by Cibernet.
